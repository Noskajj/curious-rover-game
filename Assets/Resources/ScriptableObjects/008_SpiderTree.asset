  objectName: Spider Tree
  objectDesc: A tall tree with unusually patterned and colourful bark (similar to
    some eucalyptus). Has a symbiotic relationship with a large species of spider,
    which forms its webs near the top of the tree between the two forking branches.
    The spider protects the tree's flowers from birds, and eats said birds.
