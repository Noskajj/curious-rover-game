  objectName: Giant Pitcher Plant
  objectDesc: A large red pitcher plant, which produces a black sticky nectar. A
    relative of the Tar Flower. Large enough to almost be classified as a tree. It
    can grow this large due to the abundance of insects in this area, likely due
    to stagnant water and the rotting fruit from the trees.
