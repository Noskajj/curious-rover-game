  objectName: Cliff Tree
  objectDesc: A tree which grows deeply embedded into the rock walls. These trees
    form an outer patina of toxic copper from the soil, designed to kill insects
    which would try to eat them. Their leaves gather large amounts of copper, and
    are dropped over time to avoid the tree poisoning itself.
