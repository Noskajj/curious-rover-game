  objectName: Cliff Tree
  objectDesc: A tree which grows deeply embedded into the rock walls. Large, red,
    round fruits grow from it, on very long stems that hang down. The tree has a
    metagenetic lifecycle, where it alternates between growing on the cliff walls
    and on the ground every generation. The ground-based trees grow from the red
    fruits, and have a seed that spins around and flies in the air, which get stuck
    in cracks in the cliff and grow into the cliffside form.
